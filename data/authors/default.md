I'm a UK-based full-stack developer currently working at Cuckoo Internet as part of the platform team. We're building state-of-the-art serverless microservices, and I'm excited to be part of this cutting-edge work.

My passion for building great software drives me to constantly learn and grow. Over the past decade or so, I've worked with a variety of stacks and technologies. However, I've found my place with JavaScript and the node ecosystem. That said, I'm always interested in exploring new stacks and technologies.

Currently I am working with react, redux and AWS during the day, and Deno / Fresh at home. I'm experienced with C# .NET and spent the first few years of my software career building web apps using this technology. I also have a strong grasp of Vue, Angular and vanilla JS.
