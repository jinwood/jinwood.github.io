### Hobbies and Interests

I'm a huge music fan and I love exploring different genres. You can often find me at concerts or festivals, soaking in the live experience. Travel's been a big part of my life. I've been lucky enough to visit many countries. I'm also into gaming. I really like indie games like Slay the Spire and enjoy the competitive scene of Counterstrike. I try to stay fit. I practice Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, but I'm taking a little break right now due to an injury.
