# Employment

#### Cuckoo Fibre - Full Stack Engineer

###### 04-2022 - Present

During my tenure at Cuckoo, I have played a pivotal role in various projects. Initially, I led a complete redesign of the cuckoo blog, meeting a tight deadline to coincide with the launch of the new [cuckoo brand](https://www.cuckoo.co/articles/introducing-our-new-brand-and-design-system). My next major piece of work was a design & build for a contracts microservice. This would handle the lifecycle between a customer and cuckoo, acting as the "source of truth" for things like product selection, dates, contract versions, etc. The project was build using the latest AWS features and tools, such as Lambda, CDK, DynamoDB, SQS and more. Post-acquisition, as a team we've been pushing our stack forward and have adopted a fully distributed system using Kafka (AWS MSK).
