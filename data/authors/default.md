I'm a UK-based full-stack developer previously working at Cuckoo Internet as part of the platform team. Working on state-of-the-art serverless microservices and fast, attractive and user-friendly web interfaces. After taking voluntary redundancy in August, I'm available for new opportunities.

Currently my main technology focus is around:

- JavaScript / TypeScript
- Modern React.js (nextjs, hooks, context)
- CSS in JS (styled components etc)
- GraphQL (Apollo)
- Serverless (AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, SQS, CloudFormation)
- Node.js

My passion for building great software drives me to constantly learn and grow. Over the past decade or so, I've worked with a variety of stacks and technologies. However, I've found my place with JavaScript and the node ecosystem - I'm always interested in exploring new stacks and technologies.

### Hobbies and Interests

I'm a huge music fan and I love exploring different genres. You can often find me at concerts or festivals, soaking in the live experience. Travel's been a big part of my life. I've been lucky enough to visit many countries. I'm also into gaming. I really like indie games like Slay the Spire and enjoy the competitive scene of CS GO. I try to stay fit. I practice Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, but I'm taking a little break right now due to an injury.
